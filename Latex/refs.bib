Monte Carlo simulations based on PENELOPE code and measurements with three different detectors (PTW Semiflex 31010 chamber, PTW PinPoint 31016 chamber and PTW Diode 60008) have been carried out. The geometry of the micro-multileaf collimator was tested by calculating the transmission through it and it was needed to reduce the separation between the leafs indicated by the manufacturer to reproduce the experimental results. An approximate simulation in which only Compton interactions of photons are considered was analyzed, providing a good agreement with the full simulations. With the Monte Carlo model fixed, output factors for various field sizes were calculated and compared to the experimental ones, obtaining a good agreement. Percentage depth doses and transverse profiles at two depths measured with the Diode for small fields were well reproduced by the simulation, while the measurements performed with the PinPoint chamber showed differences in the Percentage depth doses, at large depths, and in the transverse profiles, at the penumbra. Monte Carlo simulations and Semiflex and Diode measurements, performed for a 7 cm x 7 cm field, were in nice agreement, while those obtained with the PinPoint chamber showed differences that increased with the depth in water. At the phantom entrance, all measurements showed non-negligible differences what made Monte Carlo a good option to estimate the absorbed dose in this region.",

abstract = {The purpose of this study was to present a Monte Carlo (MC) simulation method based on a virtual source, jaw, and MLC model to calculate dose in patient for helical tomotherapy without the need of calculating phase-space files (PSFs). Current studies on the tomotherapy MC simulation adopt a full MC model, which includes extensive modeling of radiation source, primary and secondary jaws, and multileaf collimator (MLC). In the full MC model, PSFs need to be created at different scoring planes to facilitate the patient dose calculations. In the present work, the virtual source model (VSM) we established was based on the gold standard beam data of a tomotherapy unit, which can be exported from the treatment planning station (TPS). The TPS-generated sinograms were extracted from the archived patient XML (eXtensible Markup Language) files. The fluence map for the MC sampling was created by incorporating the percentage leaf open time (LOT) with leaf filter, jaw penumbra, and leaf latency contained from sinogram files. The VSM was validated for various geometry setups and clinical situations involving heterogeneous media and delivery quality assurance (DQA) cases. An agreement of was obtained between the measured and simulated results for percent depth doses (PDDs) and open beam profiles for all three jaw settings in the VSM commissioning. The accuracy of the VSM leaf filter model was verified in comparing the measured and simulated results for a Picket Fence pattern. An agreement of was achieved between the presented VSM and a published full MC model for heterogeneous phantoms. For complex clinical head and neck (HN) cases, the VSM-based MC simulation of DQA plans agreed with the film measurement with 98\% of planar dose pixels passing on the 2\%/2 mm gamma criteria. For patient treatment plans, results showed comparable dose-volume histograms (DVHs) for planning target volumes (PTVs) and organs at risk (OARs). Deviations observed in this study were consistent with literature. The VSM-based MC simulation approach can be feasibly built from the gold standard beam model of a tomotherapy unit. The accuracy of the VSM was validated against measurements in homogeneous media, as well as published full MC model in heterogeneous media. PACS numbers: 87.53.-j, 87.55.K-},

A 6 MV Elekta Precise linac that incorporates a 3Dline L’Arancio dynamic micro-multileaf collimator was considered [3]. The capabilities of the virtual source model have been tested against full simulations performed with the Monte Carlo simulation code PENELOPE using both PENELOPE itself and the rapid Monte Carlo code DPM. The reference 10cm×10cm radiation field as well as small fields of 1.2cmcm×1.2cm, 2.9cmcm×2.9cm and 5.8cmcm×5.8cm were considered. The dynamic micro-multileaf collimator effect can be included in the virtual source model by reducing the width of the photon primary source by a factor 3. In all cases the virtual source model simulations were in very good agreement with the complete ones including the linac and collimator geometries.}

abstract={The rapid development of deep learning, a family of machine learning techniques, has spurred much interest in its application to medical imaging problems. Here, we develop a deep learning algorithm that can accurately detect breast cancer on screening mammograms using an ``end-to-end'' training approach that efficiently leverages training datasets with either complete clinical annotation or only the cancer status (label) of the whole image. In this approach, lesion annotations are required only in the initial training stage, and subsequent stages require only image-level labels, eliminating the reliance on rarely available lesion annotations. Our all convolutional network method for classifying screening mammograms attained excellent performance in comparison with previous methods. On an independent test set of digitized film mammograms from the Digital Database for Screening Mammography (CBIS-DDSM), the best single model achieved a per-image AUC of 0.88, and four-model averaging improved the AUC to 0.91 (sensitivity: 86.1{\%}, specificity: 80.1{\%}). On an independent test set of full-field digital mammography (FFDM) images from the INbreast database, the best single model achieved a per-image AUC of 0.95, and four-model averaging improved the AUC to 0.98 (sensitivity: 86.7{\%}, specificity: 96.1{\%}). We also demonstrate that a whole image classifier trained using our end-to-end approach on the CBIS-DDSM digitized film mammograms can be transferred to INbreast FFDM images using only a subset of the INbreast data for fine-tuning and without further reliance on the availability of lesion annotations. These findings show that automatic deep learning methods can be readily trained to attain high accuracy on heterogeneous mammography platforms, and hold tremendous promise for improving clinical tools to reduce false positive and false negative screening mammography results.

	abstract = {Currently methods for predicting absorbed dose after administering a radiopharmaceutical are rather crude in daily clinical practice. Most importantly, individual tissue density distributions as well as local variations of the concentration of the radiopharmaceutical are commonly neglected. The current study proposes machine learning techniques like Green’s function-based empirical mode decomposition and deep learning methods on U-net architectures in conjunction with soft tissue kernel Monte Carlo (MC) simulations to overcome current limitations in precision and reliability of dose estimations for clinical dosimetric applications. We present a hybrid method (DNN-EMD) based on deep neural networks (DNN) in combination with empirical mode decomposition (EMD) techniques. The algorithm receives x-ray computed tomography (CT) tissue density maps and dose maps, estimated according to the MIRD protocol, i.e. employing whole organ S-values and related time-integrated activities (TIAs), and from measured SPECT distributions of 177Lu radionuclei, and learns to predict individual absorbed dose distributions. In a second step, density maps are replaced by their intrinsic modes as deduced from an EMD analysis. The system is trained using individual full MC simulation results as reference. Data from a patient cohort of 26 subjects are reported in this study. The proposed methods were validated employing a leave-one-out cross-validation technique. Deviations of estimated dose from corresponding MC results corroborate a superior performance of the newly proposed hybrid DNN-EMD method compared to its related MIRD DVK dose calculation. Not only are the mean deviations much smaller with the new method, but also the related variances are much reduced. If intrinsic modes of the tissue density maps are input to the algorithm, variances become even further reduced though the mean deviations are less affected. The newly proposed hybrid DNN-EMD method for individualized radiation dose prediction outperforms the MIRD DVK dose calculation method. It is fast enough to be of use in daily clinical practice.}

abstract={Personalized dosimetry with high accuracy is crucial owing to the growing interests in personalized medicine. The direct Monte Carlo simulation is considered as a state-of-art voxel-based dosimetry technique; however, it incurs an excessive computational cost and time. To overcome the limitations of the direct Monte Carlo approach, we propose using a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) for the voxel dose prediction. PET and CT image patches were used as inputs for the CNN with the given ground truth from direct Monte Carlo. The predicted voxel dose rate maps from the CNN were compared with the ground truth and dose rate maps generated voxel S-value (VSV) kernel convolution method, which is one of the common voxel-based dosimetry techniques. The CNN-based dose rate map agreed well with the ground truth with voxel dose rate errors of 2.54{\%}{\thinspace}{\textpm}{\thinspace}2.09{\%}. The VSV kernel approach showed a voxel error of 9.97{\%}{\thinspace}{\textpm}{\thinspace}1.79{\%}. In the whole-body dosimetry study, the average organ absorbed dose errors were 1.07{\%}, 9.43{\%}, and 34.22{\%} for the CNN, VSV, and OLINDA/EXM dosimetry software, respectively. The proposed CNN-based dosimetry method showed improvements compared to the conventional dosimetry approaches and showed results comparable with that of the direct Monte Carlo simulation with significantly lower calculation time.},
